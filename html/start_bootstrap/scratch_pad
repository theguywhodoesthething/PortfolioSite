Hello, my name is Matt! I'm a 34 year old full stack java web developer based in Portland, Oregon.

I'm a specialist in back end Java but I love all things <em>web dev</em>. I spent 5 years in the United States Marine Corps before getting my Bachelor of Science in Economics from Portland State University. I recently graduated from the <a href="http://skilldistillery.com/">Skill Distillery</a> in Denver, Colorado.

While working at Intel Corporation I discovered that I have a strong passion for the creative and disciplined problem solving that goes into web development. Nothing excites me more than scalable, readable code.

I grew up in the Pacific Northwest and love being outdoors. In my free time I enjoy playing sports, traveling and experiencing new and exciting adventures.
